  Once upon a time, seven little elves were traveling through the magic forest to start their first day of class. The leading elf, 
Tom, has never stepped out of the magic forest before and is extremely panicked, but as the oldest of all of his brothers and sisters,
he has to act tough. The forest is pretty small and it did not take them a long time before they reach the edge of the forest.
Yet there is a beautiful woman lying on the ground with her skin pale as a sheet of paper and eyes staring at the sky like a precious marble. 
Elves have never such a beautiful woman and started to approach her unconsciously; only thing is that when Tom touches her skin, 
it was ice cold, when he feels her breath, he cannot feel anything. Apparently, she is dead.
